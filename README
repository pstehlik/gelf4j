gelf4j is set out to be an easy to use log4j appender to log to graylog2 via GELF messages.

---

Build with gradle via `gradle build` from the root directory

---

Deploy by placing the gelf4j.jar file in your class path.
If you don't have Groovy 1.7.6 already in your deployment, also place the groovy-all-1.7.6.jar in your classpath.
Of course you need log4j as well. gelf4j is built against version 1.2.16.

In a future release I hope to bundle this all up in a pom or so for easier distribution.

---

Configure the log4j appender by setting the appender class as usual and maintaining these additional configurations for the appender:
Configuration options:

'additionalFields'
Set as a java Collection in your config to include additional fields to send to graylog2 server.
Default: empty/no additional fields added

'facility'
Set the facility number to use.
Default: 'GELF'

'graylogServerHost'
The host name of your graylog server. Maintained as String.
Default: 'localhost'

'graylogServerPort'
The port of your graylog server. Maintained as Integer.
Default: 12201

'host'
Sets the host name that should be mentioned in the GELF message
Default: Name of the host that runs the JVM with fallback to 'unknown_host'

'maxChunkSize'
The amount of bytes a message chunk can contain.
Default: 8154

---

Notes:
- The 'short_message' of the GELF messages is limited to 250 chars and just takes the first 250 chars of the log4j message. The 'full_message' contains the full log4j text.
- The appender does not layout the message according to a message layout. It sends all the fields to the graylog2 server where you can query/look at the log.
